# YT Comments

## Why?

I created this web appilication for people to post comments on youtube that have them turned off.

## Running on your own

To run on your own you must split the hosting between the backend and frontend. Then edit the config.js in each

You can host the api anywhere but I would suggest hosting the frontend on heroku
